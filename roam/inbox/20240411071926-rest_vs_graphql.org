#+title: REST-vs-GraphQL


* GraphQL
- Sits between Client and Backend services
- Multiple resource requests into a single query.
  
** Compare
Both uses:
- http
- make Request via URL
- returns JSON response in same shape
  
*** REST Client --> GET /books/123 --> REST Server
https:://example.com/api/v3/products
https:://example.com/api/v3/users
.. where `/products` & `/users` are RESOURCES
#+begin_src js
{
  "title": "C Language",
  "authors": [{
      "name": "Brian Kernighan"
  },
  {
      "name": "Dennis M. Ritchie"
  }]
  ...
}
#+end_src
